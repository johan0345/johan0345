## Hi, my name is Johan 👋
🎓 1st-year AD Software Development student at Hogeschool Utrecht.<br>
💻 Interested in: backend development, Java, C#, Python and web development.<br>
🚀 Currently looking for an internship for year 2 (Sept 2026 – Feb 2027).<br>

I’m a first-year AD Software Development student at Hogeschool Utrecht with a background in MBO-4 Web Development (GLU).<br>
During my studies I work with Java, C#, Python and Scrum in group projects.<br>
Because of my web development background, I already have experience with HTML, CSS and Ruby on Rails.<br>
I love digging into code and figuring out how everything fits together — it helps me really get to know a language and how it works.<br>

My current goal is to look for an internship for year 2 as a software developer so I can gain real-world experience.<br>
